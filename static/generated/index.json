    "prompt": "A photographic image of a calm, softly lit workspace viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, showing a person in a relaxed state of concentration, subtly illuminated by ambient natural light filtering through a window. The subject is surrounded by authentic tools of their craft, arranged naturally, with gentle cool-neutral tones and occasional warm highlights in the environment. The composition uses negative space and layered depth, with the subject off-center, creating a sense of quiet focus and steady flow. The mood is tranquil and supportive, emphasizing human presence and subtle breakthrough, with no visible tech, screens, or text—just an intimate moment of sustained attention in a real environment.",

    "prompt": "A documentary-style photograph of a person in a calm, focused state, working at a desk in a softly lit room during early morning.

The environment is gently illuminated with cool-neutral natural light, with subtle warm highlights from a desk lamp or window. The composition uses asymmetrical balance and leaves generous negative space, with layered depth showing a softly blurred background. The mood is one of quiet confidence and flow, capturing a genuine moment of subtle breakthrough without distraction. No screens, text, or abstract elements are present—only real objects and a sense of peaceful productivity.",
